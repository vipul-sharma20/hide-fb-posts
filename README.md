Warning
-------

Facebook gives following warning on opening JS console:


    This is a browser feature intended for developers. If someone told you to
    copy-paste something here to enable a Facebook feature or "hack" someone's
    account, it is a scam and will give them access to your Facebook account.

This project is just for fun. Although this is safe to run but, if you are
trying to modify this code then, try at your own risk
