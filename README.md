* **Please tell me what you really think about me, honestly and anonymously https://sayat.me/pretentiousguy**

How it works?
-------------

* copy-paste content of `hide.js` and paste it in JS developer console of your browser to hide posts.

* Use the following keyboard shortcuts to open developers console:

    (Chrome):
    * Command + Option + J (Mac)
    * Control + Shift + J (Windows/Linux).

    (Firefox):
    * either select "Web Console" from the Web Developer submenu in the Firefox Menu (or Tools menu if you display the menu bar or are on Mac OS X)
    * or press the Ctrl + Shift + K (Command + Option + K on OS X) keyboard shortcut.

Warning
-------

Facebook gives following warning on opening JS console:


    This is a browser feature intended for developers. If someone told you to
    copy-paste something here to enable a Facebook feature or "hack" someone's
    account, it is a scam and will give them access to your Facebook account.

This project is just for fun. Although this is safe to run but, if you are
trying to modify this code then, try at your own risk
